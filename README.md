📋 Project: People Register Form

This project is a simple web application where users can input and register personal data (name, surname, and age) through a form. It stores the entries in an array and allows users to display the data dynamically on the page.

📁 Files:

- `index.html` → Contains the HTML structure with form inputs and buttons.
- `index.js` → Contains the logic to add and display people.
- `style.css` → (Optional) Add your styles here to improve layout and visual design.

🚀 Features:

- Input fields for name, surname, and age.
- "Add" button to store the data into an array.
- "Display" button to show the saved data in the result section.

🛠 Technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

📌 How it works:

1. User fills the form.
2. Clicks the **"Add"** button to save the data.
3. Clicks the **"Display"** button to render the entered data below the form.

⚠️ Note:

- The data is stored only during the current session (in-memory with JavaScript).
- No backend or database is connected.

🧪 Example Output:

Nome = João  
Sobrenome = Silva  
Idade = 30

📦 To run:

Just open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
